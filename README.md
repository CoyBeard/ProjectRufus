The code for all three Vex Brains:

  The master brain is the one in front, then the left worker and right worker are the left and right brains 
based on the robot's left and right. 

  Fair warning the code isn't optimized and I regret not writing more sudo code lol. 
  
  The brains are a wired link so the power wire of the smart cable must be cut to preserve the life of the 
brains.
